# Weekplanner

Schedule management app for the GIRAF ecosystem — helps children with autism manage their weekly activities using pictograms.

## Architecture

```
Flutter app (frontend/)
       │
       ├──→ Weekplanner API (backend/)    .NET 10, activity CRUD only
       │         │
       │         └──→ PostgreSQL (port 5433)
       │
       └──→ GIRAF Core API (external)     Users, orgs, citizens, pictograms
                 │
                 └──→ PostgreSQL (port 5432)
```

The weekplanner backend stores only **Activities**. All shared entities (users, organizations, citizens, grades, pictograms) are managed by [giraf-core](https://github.com/aau-giraf/giraf-core). JWTs issued by Core are validated locally using a shared `JWT_SECRET`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the full stack

Use [giraf-deploy](https://github.com/aau-giraf/giraf-deploy) to run everything:

```bash
cd ../giraf-deploy
docker compose up -d
```

This starts giraf-core (`:8000`), weekplanner backend (`:5171`), and their databases.

### 2. Create a test user

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"test@giraf.dk","password":"GirafUgeplan2025","email":"test@giraf.dk","first_name":"Test","last_name":"User"}'
```

### 3. Create a test organisation

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/token/pair \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"test@giraf.dk","password":"GirafUgeplan2025"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access'])")

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/organizations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Organisation"}'
```

### 4. Run the Flutter app

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run -d linux \
  --dart-define=CORE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
  --dart-define=WEEKPLANNER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5171
```

For Android emulator, omit the `--dart-define` flags (defaults to `10.0.2.2`).

Log in with `test@giraf.dk` / `GirafUgeplan2025`.

## Frontend Architecture

MVVM with Provider + ChangeNotifier, following [Flutter's official app architecture guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide).

### High-Level Flutter Principles

At a high level, we keep frontend architecture intentionally simple and consistent:

1. Keep a clear flow: View -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Service
2. Keep business logic out of widgets; widgets render state and forward user intent
3. Keep services stateless and focused on HTTP/API translation only
4. Keep repositories as the data boundary and source of truth for feature data
5. Keep ViewModel state explicit (`loading`, `error`, `data`) with predictable async handling
6. Keep models immutable (`freezed`) and constructor-injected through Provider

### Flutter Architecture Standards

This frontend follows the architecture recommended by the Flutter team. **All contributors must read these before making structural changes:**

| Topic | Link | Key takeaway |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Architecture guide | [docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide) | MVVM with View → ViewModel → Repository → Service layers |
| UI layer | [docs.flutter.dev/.../ui-layer](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study/ui-layer) | Views display state, ViewModels hold logic. 1:1 relationship. Use `ChangeNotifier` + `ListenableBuilder` |
| Data layer | [docs.flutter.dev/.../data-layer](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study/data-layer) | Repositories = source of truth. Services = stateless API wrappers |
| Dependency injection | [docs.flutter.dev/.../dependency-injection](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study/dependency-injection) | Use `package:provider`. Services → Repositories → ViewModels via constructors |
| Case study (Compass) | [docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study) | Full reference app demonstrating all patterns |
| Dart best practices | [dart.dev/effective-dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart) | Naming, style, documentation, and design conventions |

**Rules we follow from the guide:**

1. **Views contain no business logic** — only layout, animation, and simple conditionals on ViewModel state
2. **ViewModels manage UI state** — expose data + command callbacks; never import Flutter widgets
3. **Repositories are the source of truth** — handle caching, retry, error mapping, and expose domain models
4. **Services are stateless** — one service per external API, return raw data only
5. **Dependencies flow one way** — View → ViewModel → Repository → Service (never backwards)
6. **Immutable models** — all data classes use `package:freezed` for deep immutability + `copyWith` + JSON
7. **Provider for DI** — `MultiProvider` at the root, `context.read()` to inject into constructors

### Package Structure

```
frontend/lib/
├── main.dart                  # Entry point, Provider setup
├── app.dart                   # MaterialApp + GoRouter
├── config/                    # API URLs, theme
├── shared/
│   ├── models/                # Freezed data classes (Activity, Citizen, etc.)
│   ├── services/              # Dio API clients (core + weekplanner)
│   └── utils/                 # JWT decode, date helpers
└── features/
    ├── auth/                  # Login, JWT storage, auth redirect
    ├── organisation_picker/   # Org list → citizen/grade selection
    └── weekplan/              # Week view, activity CRUD, pictogram selector
```

Each feature is organized by layer: `data/repositories/`, `presentation/view_models/`, `presentation/views/`, `presentation/widgets/`.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Two API clients**: separate Dio instances for giraf-core and weekplanner backend, matching the dual-backend architecture
- **JWT claim**: user ID is in the `user_id` claim (ninja-jwt default), not `sub`
- **Optimistic updates**: activity delete and toggle update the UI immediately, rolling back on API failure
- **Pagination**: giraf-core uses `{items: T[], count: number}` with `limit`/`offset`; weekplanner returns plain arrays

## Plan Status (March 2026)

Current status of the architecture hardening plan:

- Completed: backend service extraction and cleanup, typed DTOs (`DateOnly`/`TimeOnly`), cancellation propagation, health endpoint, typed endpoint results, frontend async-state consistency, and expanded frontend test coverage
- Completed: command-style async execution introduced via shared `AsyncCommand`
- Dropped by design: frontend `Result<T>` migration (not a good fit for our current ChangeNotifier/Provider MVVM style)
